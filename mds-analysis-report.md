# Technical Report: MDS Dimensionality Reduction Analysis on California Housing Dataset

## 1. Problem Overview and Challenges

The California Housing dataset presents several challenges when applying Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) for dimensionality reduction:

### 1.1 Memory Complexity Issues
- MDS requires computing pairwise distances between all samples
- Memory complexity is O(n²), where n is the number of samples
- With 16,512 samples, the full distance matrix would require approximately (16,512² * 8 bytes) ≈ 2.18 GB just for the distance matrix
- Additional memory is needed for computations and transformations

### 1.2 Computational Complexity
- MDS involves eigendecomposition of the distance matrix
- Time complexity is O(n²) for distance computation and O(n³) for classical MDS
- For large datasets, this becomes computationally prohibitive

## 2. Methodology and Solutions

To address these challenges, I implemented the following solutions:

### 2.1 Stratified Sampling Approach
- Used stratified sampling to maintain data distribution
- Implemented multiple runs to ensure stability of results
- Validated sampling distribution against full dataset
- Used 5,000 samples as an optimal balance between accuracy and computational feasibility

### 2.2 Validation Strategy
- Compared distributions of full and sampled datasets
- Implemented baseline regression without dimensionality reduction
- Performed multiple runs to assess stability
- Calculated standard deviations of metrics
- Measured execution times for different components

### 3.2 Key Findings
1. Distribution Preservation:
   - The stratified sampling approach successfully maintained the original data distribution
   - Validated through histogram comparison and statistical tests

2. Dimensionality Impact:
   - 3D reduction generally performed better than 2D
   - Trade-off between dimensionality and information preservation

3. Computational Efficiency:
   - Significant reduction in computation time compared to full dataset
   - Memory usage kept within manageable limits

## 4. Limitations and Trade-offs

1. Information Loss:
   - Some information is inevitably lost in the sampling process
   - Reduced dimensions cannot capture all original feature relationships

2. Scalability:
   - Method still has limitations for very large datasets
   - Memory requirements remain quadratic, even with sampling

3. Stability:
   - Results show some variation between runs
   - Mitigated through multiple runs and averaging

## 5. Recommendations

1. For this specific dataset:
   - Use 3D reduction if possible, as it preserves more information
   - Maintain stratified sampling approach
   - Consider sample size of 5,000 as a good balance

2. For future applications:
   - Consider alternative dimensionality reduction techniques for larger datasets
   - Implement incremental processing for very large datasets
   - Monitor memory usage and adjust sample size accordingly

## 6. Conclusion

The implemented solution successfully addresses the memory and computational challenges of applying MDS to the California Housing dataset while maintaining statistical validity. The trade-off between computational feasibility and information preservation has been optimized through careful sampling and validation procedures.
